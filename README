Project Name: Social Filtering Movie Recommendation System


Project description: A novel movie recommendation which combines normal collaborative filtering algorithm as well as social relationship. 

1. The commands to run this program: 
  make clang
  ./run

2. The final predict result will show in commandline and also save in data/testData/predictResult 

Main Functions Finished::
1. Combine the users in the users' history file(user_history.txt) and users in the social relation's file(user_social.txt)

2. Get the movies from users' history and build the user to moive rating matrix by using the information in the traing_set

3. Build users' social relationship graph 

4. Get the predict Pairs from the predictSource file(also considering if the pair is suitable for our algorithm) 

5. Calculate the similarity users for each user in predict pairs

6. Find the shorest path to each similarity users(we use a improvement of dijkstra algorithm could find all the minimum path and we also design functions to slove two equal path weight problem)

7. Improve the similarity for each similar user by using the minimum path to the similar user
  
8. Give the predicion of each pair

9. Evaluation works based on some pre-drawed evaluation datasets
